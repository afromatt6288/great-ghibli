        <section id="home">

                Welcome to Great Ghibli Bibli
            </h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    You might be wondering, "What the heck is Great Gihbli Bibli? It clearly is a nonsensical phrase!" 
                    <br/>
                    Well, you would be right. 
                    <br/>
                    However, it is a nonsensical phrase based on another well known nonsensical phrase, "Great Googily Boogily!" 
                    <br/> 
                    Now is it making sense? 
                    <br/> 
                    No...? Well, then don't worry too much about it. In any case, welcome!
